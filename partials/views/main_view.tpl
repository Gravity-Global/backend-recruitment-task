<h2> # Backend/Full-stack recruitment task </h2>
<p>1️⃣ Create a simple table which lists the users from `users.json` file</p>
<p>2️⃣ Add a "Remove" button for each row, once clicked - the selected user should be removed from the JSON file, the page should be reloaded after the button is clicked. </p>
<p>3️⃣ Add a simple form for adding a new user to the JSON file.</p>


<p>⚠️You have a free reign in terms of the architecture - creating controllers and models will be a huge plus</p>
<p>⚠️We don't insist on fancy styling for the table, but anything else than the raw layout will be appreciated</p>
<p>⚠️We will check aspects like code readability, scalability and error handling</p>
<p>⏳ Don't hurry up! Take as much time as you need</p>
<p>⚠️The easiest way to start is to fork this repository, but feel free to use any other method</p>
